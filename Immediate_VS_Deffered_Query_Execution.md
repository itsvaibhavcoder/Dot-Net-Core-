# Immediate Mode vs. Deferred Mode in Entity Framework Core

## **1. Immediate Execution (Eager Execution)**
### **Definition:**
- Executes the query as soon as it is defined and assigned to a variable.
- Fetches data from the database immediately.

### **Example:**
```csharp
var books = _context.Books.ToList(); // Executes immediately
```

### **Use Cases:**
âœ… When immediate data retrieval is required.  
âœ… When iterating over results multiple times.  
âœ… When using methods like `.First()`, `.Count()`.  

### **Performance:**
- **Pros:** Reduces database load when used correctly.
- **Cons:** May fetch more data than necessary.

---

## **2. Deferred Execution (Lazy Execution)**
### **Definition:**
- The query is only prepared but not executed until iterated.
- EF Core optimizes query execution dynamically.

### **Example:**
```csharp
var query = _context.Books.Where(b => b.Price > 20); // No execution yet
var books = query.ToList(); // Executes now
```

### **Use Cases:**
âœ… When constructing complex queries dynamically.  
âœ… When delaying execution until needed.  
âœ… When chaining query operators for filtering, sorting, etc.  

### **Performance:**
- **Pros:** Avoids unnecessary data retrieval.
- **Cons:** Can cause multiple database hits if not managed properly.

## **Comparison Table: Immediate vs. Deferred Execution**
| Feature               | Immediate Execution | Deferred Execution |
|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Execution Timing      | Executes when called | Executes when iterated |
| Query Optimization    | Less optimized | More optimized |
| Use Case             | Immediate data retrieval | Flexible query building |
| Performance Impact   | May load unnecessary data | Reduces unnecessary queries |

---

## **Conclusion**
- **Use Immediate Execution** for quick data retrieval.
- **Use Deferred Execution** for optimizing query performance and flexibility.

Understanding these execution modes ensures efficient database interactions in EF Core applications. ðŸš€
